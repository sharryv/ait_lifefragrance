          <h3 class="text-uppercase mb-4">How it all started</h3>
          <p>When I met Jeff, an artisan roaster who had recently left a Master Roasting position with a global coffee
            company. We struck up a business partnership that has lasted ever since and we’re now the closest of
            friends. He is an amazing roaster and understands the delicate nuances that coffee can bring to each cup.
          </p>
          <p>Cafes can only service a local crowd and whilst I could educate people around me, I knew that many other
            people all around Australia
            were not getting the same education and experience I was. I knew I had to think broader than just cafes.</p>

          <p>Moving online was an easy decision. It would allow me to reach Australia and the globe – not just with
            coffee, but also with coffee education. Home coffee machines were becoming better and cheaper to buy and
            this created a greater need for coffee beans and by setting up an online store we were able to help people
            get their coffee quickly and freshly.</p>
